title: Blog Setup, Part Two
---

After setting up my blog in post one, for post two I decided to change the look! It is still based on Jekyll but I'm now using the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme created by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). I prefer this clean, content-focused layout. I used this article, [Set Up a Jekyll Blog in 5 Minutes with Poole](http://www.sitepoint.com/set-jekyll-blog-5-minutes-poole/) to, you guessed it, set up this blog layout quickly. 

Why use Jekyll? I want to host my blog for free on Github pages, so it needs to be a static site. I don't need a robust blog at the moment, just the ability to occasionally post. I also like that I can write my posts directly in my text editor, and not through a rich text or WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor which often adds unnecessary formatting to posts. So... if you would like a blog that looks similar, just visit the links above or this [Github repo](http://getpoole.com) to get started.

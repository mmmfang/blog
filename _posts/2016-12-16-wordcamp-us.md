title: Reflections on my First WordCamp
---

I recently attended [Wordcamp US](https://2016.us.wordcamp.org), a community conference for Wordpress. It was a great experience! Here are some things I learned and my impressions of my first (but certainly not last) WordCamp.

1. I didn’t know that Wordpress had a mascot. A cute one as well! Let me tell you it was delightful to get a plush Wappuu upon checking into the conference.

2. The sessions were interesting and I found many relevant to what I wanted to learn. All the panels were live-streamed for free, and are available at Wordpress.tv so I can watch the sessions I missed. I appreciate the open knowledge sharing. I took plenty of notes during the [SEO talk](http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/11/joost-de-valk-wordpress-and-seo-in-2016) by the founder of Yoast SEO and the session about [Google trends](http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/11/maile-ohye-a-view-from-google-the-latest-in-google-and-google).

3. I learned that Wordpress powers over 26% of the web, but is facing competition from competitors like Squarespace, Wix, Weebly, etc. When using those companies’ website updaters, those editors are more visual -  you can make changes directly to your page (instead of having to press the preview button). It is interesting to think about how Wordpress will, or has to, evolve to match the experience provided by other platforms.

4. There was diversity in age and gender and technical ability. This is a good thing. While I haven’t been to many tech events, I sure have been the sole or one of two females at a tech event. Other conferences may have more high-level/technical talks, and fewer beginner-friendly talks. In order to use Wordpress you don’t need to know how to code, so the talks need not be super high-level or intimidating.

5. Since I needed to figure out hosting I made a point to talk to all the vendors. It was very useful to talk to companies in-person and made me feel reassured in the choice of host.

6. Thanks to the organizers and all involved in WordCamp US to make it a great experience. I feel lucky that it was near enough for me to bus down for a day, and it was nice to bump into two people I know! I have only been developing in Wordpress for a few months (aside from using Wordpress.com for some long-forgotten blogs in college) so it was nice to already feel a part of the Wordpress community. I hope to be able to return for the full Wordcamp US conference experience, and to contribute to Wordpress core during Contributor Day!

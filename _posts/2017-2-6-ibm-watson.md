title: Experimenting with IBM Watson
---

I’ve been hearing about IBM Watson a lot recently in the news - primarily about reports that Watson was able to diagnose cancers about as accurately as humans could, after it scanned through thousands of photos of cancers. I have mixed feelings about this - more healthcare diagnostic tools is good and so increasing access to knowledge. But not all problems can be solved by technology alone. A biopsy is critical to knowing if there is indeed a cancer, and I hope having a computer or app saying it is unlikely to be a cancer, doesn’t dissuade one from visiting a doctor for further evaluation. After all, there are atypical forms of cancers.

Also I still am a little concerned with the rising use of artificial intelligence, as I just saw the movie Ex Machina…But I digress.

So I wanted to learn more about IBM Watson, but wasn’t sure where to start. There are a lot of resources on their website, so many that a starting point isn’t exactly clear. So it was very useful to attend an event put on by IBM Watson, [Coding Cognitive](http://www.acehotel.com/about/coding-cognitive), and have IBM staff on hand to answer questions and explain Watson more in detail. We mostly followed through a [tutorial](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/text-bot); though it was fairly straightforward to follow along the tutorial and get a working app up, I wouldn’t have even known how to find this tutorial sans this event. It was also nice to see many female attendees.

Though my weather app will disappear after my 30 day trial period is up, it was fun to have a working product at the end of an hour or two (though I primarily just followed instructions correctly)! I would like to get through other tutorials before my time is up, in particular the [image recognition one](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/learning-lab/use-cases/use-deep-learning-to-analyze-images) and maybe this [Harry Potter one](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/learning-lab/use-cases/build-harry-potter-sorting-hat).

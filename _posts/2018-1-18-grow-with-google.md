title: Grow with Google Mobile Web Scholarship
---

Google announced an initiative in conjunction with online learning platform Udacity, to award 50,000 scholarships to online courses. This initiative was open to beginning and intermediate web or Android developers. I applied since the application was very brief and got into the Offline Web Applications 3 month challenge.

Now I'm not entirely sure what are the differences between this program and the free Udacity courses online - I think it has more support, and the chance to win the paid Mobile Specialist Web Track Nanodegree program after completing the 3 months.

It will be good motivation to delve into topics I have been meaning to study, key among them ES6! Once I become comfortable with its syntax, I can delve into learning React. I'm also excited about learning about Progressive Web apps and offline web applications. I think knowing more about providing a quality offline experience will be useful when thinking about slow internet connections. Looking forward to getting started!
